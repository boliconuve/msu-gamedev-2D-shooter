# msu-gamedev-2D-shooter
I have created a 2D shooter game made in Unity 3D.

My main goal with this project is to learn and apply art, design and programming concepts. I made this approach to grow my knowledge within my chosen discipline, while art, design and code come together to make a game. To become a better game developer.

# Some of the concepts I have learned:
  - Creating 2D games in Unity.
  - Working with 2D sprites.
  - Creating 2D animations.
  - Implementing typical 2D shooter mechanics.
  - Using Unity Prefabs.

# Other concepts I've also learned:
  - Creating a complete game loop.
  - Creating UI elements that work across multiple resolutions and aspect ratios.
  - Unity best practices.
  - Unity tips and techniques.
